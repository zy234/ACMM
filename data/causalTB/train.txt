income O
of O
National O

declined B-Effect
to O
$ O
6.3 O

a O
result O
of O

Property O

casualty O
insurance O
has O
been O
a O
tough O
business O

natural O

it O

the O

The O
warning B-Effect

This O

" O
that O
the O

imply O
that O
the O

would O
be O

Compaq O

said O
that O
its O

rose O

bolstered B-Effect
by O
unusual O

Nevertheless O
, O
American O
officials O
over O
the O

became O
more O
open O

that O
by O
destroying B-Cause
Saddam O

they O
hope O
to O
destroy B-Effect
his O
regime O
-- O
a O
goal O
likely O
to O
be O
supported O
by O
most O
Americans O
. O

But O
because O
these O
claims O
are O
more O
difficult O
to O
evaluate O
and O
have O
been O
coming B-Cause
in O
more O
slowly O
, O
the O

If O
that O

true O
, O
the O

the O

the O

The O
unpredictability B-Cause
of O
Iraq O
